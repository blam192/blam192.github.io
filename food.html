          <h3 class="name">Bun Bo Hue</h3>
          <p><a href= https://pupswithchopsticks.com/bun-bo-hue/ class="link1">Bun Bo Hue</a>, also known as Spicy Beef Noodle Soup, is like an elevated version of your good old pho. Rather than the thin rice noodles you get in Pho, Bun Bo Hue is served with vermicelli. This Spicy Beef Noodle Soup still contains some of your favorite beef brisket, but there's also items like Cha Lau and pork blood curd. Some of the predominant flavors are lemongrass and fermented shrimp sauce. A sip of this soup warms you up on a cold day and activates your salivatory glands. Be sure to find some of your more spice tolerant friends and try out a Bun Bo Hue the next time you're at a Vietnamese restaurant.</p>

          <h3 class="name">Banh Mi</h3>
          <p>A <a href= https://www.vietnamenu.com/vietnamese-food-banh-mi-cha-lua.html class="link2">Banh Mi</a> is basically Vietnamese for bread. A classic banh mi consists of a baguette, split lengthwise, filled with some Cha Lau (pork sausage), pate (duck liver), cilantro, cucumber, pickled carrots and daikons, mayonnaise, and jalapeno. However, the types of filings has expanded over the years and people started put many different items in them. I've heard of people putting peanut butter on a baguette as well which is slightly different to me. A Banh Mi is perfect for any meal, be it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or even a quick afternoon snack. The next time you're looking for a quick meal and don't want just any sandwich, find the closest Banh M shop!</p>

          <h3 class="name">Com Tam</h3>
          <p>In my opinion, <a href= http://yummyvietnam.net/vietnamese-com-tam-recipe-how-to-make-authentic-broken-rice/ class="link3">Com Tam</a>, aka a rice plate, is one of the easier dishes to make. One of the key differences is that the rice for Com Tam is broken rice, which absorbs liquids (in this case fish sauce) more easily compared to our regular rice. A piece of BBQ meat (pork, beef, chicken, or shrimp) typically complements the rice and fish sauce along with some fresh cucumbers, tomato, lettuce, and pickled daikon and carrots. One of the commonly served items on a plate of Com Tam is known as a Steamed Egg Meatloaf. I'm more of a picky eater so I just prefer a side of a fried egg. </p>

          <h3 class="name">Banh Xeo</h3>
          <p><a href=https://www.hungryhuy.com/banh-xeo-savory-vietnamese-crepes/ class="link4">Banh Xeo</a>, also known as a Vietnamese pizza/crepe, is my alltime favorite dish. It is relatively easy but messy to make. All you need is the rice flour along with some spices (I typically grab a premixed bag at supermarkets), coconut milk, some of your favorite meats, onions, and bean sprouts and you can assemble this delicious dish. You basically sautee the meat and pour the batter on top to fry and you'll end up with a good old savory crepe. In stores, Banh Xeos are made with pork and shrimp; however, my mom makes it with chicken. Once the Crepe is ready, you would break it apart, wrap it in some green leaf lettuce, and dip into fish sauce. I love Banh Xeos because they're like a perfect balance of oily and healthy food. </p>

          <h3 class="name">Banh Uot Cha Lua</h3>
          <p>In case you didn't catch it earlier, Cha Lua is basically a Vietnamese pork roll. It's commonly served in dishes (Banh Mi and Bun Bo Hue above), but one of the best ways to have it is with <a href=https://www.vickypham.com/blog/vietnamese-steamed-rice-rolls-banh-cuon class= "link5">Banh Uot</a>. Banh Uot are steamed rice noodle rolls. It's served with some crispy shallots (which everyone should try), fish sauce, and cha lau! If you're looking for something on the healthier side, Banh Uot Cha Lua is a perfect dish to fill you up. All you need to do is find the ingredients at a local grocery supermarket, and assemble the Banh Uot and Cha Lua in the steamer and top with fish sauce and fried shallots.</p>
